            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>Spanning all the way back to when I first started school, I have attended five different institutions:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Ainsworth Elementary</strong> - I went to school here from kindergarten to fifth grade. This is a Spanish immersion school in Portland where all of our math classes were taught in Spanish.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunnyside Environmental School</strong> - My mom actually helped start this school in Portland, which focuses on environmental subjects. Once a week each class goes on a field study so we all learned outside of the classroom. Unlike most people I know, I thoroughly enjoyed middle school.</li>
                <li><strong>Grant High School</strong> - This is the high school I went to, located in NE Portland.</li>
                <li><strong>University of Washington</strong> - I only went here the first two quarters of my freshman year. I originally wanted to study Environmental Engineering but I did not have a good experience here so I withdrew the beginning of Spring quarter to figure out a different path.</li>
                <li><strong>University of Oregon</strong> - I transferred here my sophomore year, undecided of what I wanted to major in. By the end of my time here, I ended up majoring in applied mathematics and minoring in business.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>

              <h3>Job Experience</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>Throughout my life I have worked three seperate jobs:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Gabriel's Bakery</strong> - This is my dad's bakery that he started before I was born.  I have worked various jobs there off and on my entire life and I am still working there to this day. On the weekends I usually work at the PSU Farmer's Market selling our product and I also make and sell my own granola that is now part of the various baked goods that we sell.</li>
                <li><strong>Nicaragua Internship</strong>  - Last summer I travelled to a small town in Nicaragua for an internship where I helped a group of kids organize and expand on two businesses projects that they had started: bike rentals, and selling hand made jewelry and clothing.</li>
                <li><strong>Kitchen Assistant</strong> - During my time at the University of Oregon, I worked as a kitchen assistant at a sorority.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Now, I have decided to join Epicodus because I am ready for a life change. I took a java class at UW and enjoyed it a lot so I want to pursue programming further. There are jobs I could get from my major in college but nothing that I enjoy as much as coding (so far), I also don't want to work at the bakery for the rest of my life so Epicodus seemed like the right step for me.</p>

              <h3>Interests/Skills</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>I fill up my free time with several different activities:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Exercise</strong> - I have played soccer my entire life, and I still try to play once or twice a week. I also enjoy going on runs, yoga, and biking, which I engage in regularly.</li>
                <li><strong>Reading</strong> - Especially with all of this screen time at Epicodus, I have been reading every night when I have time instead of watching television or staring at my computer more. I generally enjoy reading sci/fi and fantasy novels and right now I am reading the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov.</li>
                <li><strong>Cooking</strong> - My family has always made home-cooked meals most nights so naturally, I took up cooking as well. I make my own lunch everyday and switch of making meals with my family for dinner at home.</li>
                <li><strong>Music</strong> - Growing up I took guitar lessons and piano lessons. Although I stopped playing the guitar years ago, I still come back to the piano here and there to make sure I can at least still play a few songs well. Also, I listen to lots of different music as well.</li>
